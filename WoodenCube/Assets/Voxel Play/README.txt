What's Voxel Play?
--------------------

Voxel Play is a voxelized environment for your game. It aims to provide a complete solution for terrain, sky, water, UI, inventory and character interaction.


How to use this asset
---------------------
Firstly, you should run the Demo scenes to get an idea of the overall functionality.
Then, please take a look at the online documentation to learn how to use all the features that Voxel Play can offer.

Documentation/API reference
---------------------------
The user manual is available online:

Future updates
--------------

All our assets follow an incremental development process by which a few beta releases are published on our support forum (kronnect.com).
We encourage you to signup and engage our forum. The forum is the primary support and feature discussions medium.

Of course, all updates of Voxel Play will be eventually available on the Asset Store.
